# Verismo - an Operatic Companion
Verismo is an app designed to immerse users in the world of opera, offering both biographical and musical insights. It provides users with the opportunity to not only listen to operatic works but also to understand their context and intricate details.

The listening experience is enriched with librettos, character descriptions, and translations into any selected language using the Translation API. All text-based views feature dynamically changing language content to cater to a diverse audience.

Users can explore characters from across Europe and choose from a variety of recordings, enhancing their appreciation of the operatic art form.

Each composer and opera featured in the app comes with carefully curated summaries and biographical notes, providing a comprehensive understanding of the works and their creators.

**Accessibility** is extremely important to me, which is why the app offers support for various options such as Dynamic Type, Reduced Motion and Transparency and VoiceOver. This ensures a dignified and inclusive experience for all users, regardless of their needs.

The app is available for iOS, iPadOS, and macOS.

All audiovisual materials used in Verismo are released under the CC-BY license or are in the Public Domain, with appropriate annotations within the app. My special thanks go to the [Europeana](www.europeana.eu) initiative, which has enabled me to draw on Europe's extensive cultural heritage.

In the **future** I plan to integrate with Apple Music to provide an even more seamless listening experience. Additionally, I will research options such as the Music Haptics API to further enhance accessibility.
